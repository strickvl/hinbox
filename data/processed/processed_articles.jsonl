The Trump administration has also not released the migrants' names, although at least two have been identified by their relatives through pictures released of the first flight.\n\nBy not disclosing the migrants' identities, the government has prevented their relatives from learning where they are being held and complicated lawyers' efforts to challenge their detention.\n\nBut The New York Times has obtained the names of 53 men who are being held in Camp 6, a prison building where, until recently, the military held al-Qaida suspects. The Times has published the list.\n\nA week after the first 10 men arrived from detention in Texas, the specifics of their status remain unknown. Officials for the Defense and Homeland Security departments have said little about them other than their nationality. They've also described some as gang members, without offering evidence.\n\nOn Wednesday, Tricia McLaughlin, a homeland security spokesperson, said that the agency had sent nearly 100 people to Guantanamo Bay and that each had final deportation orders. All of them were considered to have \"committed a crime by entering the United States illegally,\" and the group included \"violent gang members and other high-threat illegal aliens,\" she said.\n\nNot all migrants in ICE detention entered the United States illegally. Some, for example, requested asylum at the border but were eventually rejected. The government did not offer evidence that all of the men taken to Guantanamo had sneaked across the border.\n\nThe government has periodically taken migrants picked up at sea to Guantanamo to be processed. But it has not previously taken people who were already detained on U.S. soil -- and therefore have constitutional rights, even if they were in the country unlawfully -- to a U.S. detention facility abroad.\n\nNonetheless, a picture of the Guantanamo operation is emerging as military guards and medics scramble to figure out how to hold dozens of migrants. Troops had previously helped handle the base's detainees in the war against terrorism, whose numbers are now down to 15 after transfers late in the Biden administration.\n\nEight people described the migrant operations at Guantanamo. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing sensitive information about ongoing security operations in a military zone.\n\nOne person familiar with the operation said that Camp 6 is in disrepair, with broken showers and doors and other faulty equipment that make parts of it unusable. This person also said that only two ICE officials were working inside Camp 6.\n\nThe Trump administration has told congressional staff members that only six ICE officials are working on the migrant detention operation, according to multiple people familiar with a briefing.\n\nThe congressional staff members were told that the prison building has 176 cells but capacity for only 144 men. It was not clear if that meant 144 cells are in working condition or if this was a reference to consideration of holding two men in each of 72 cells, using cots.\n\nTwo people with knowledge of prison operations said the detainees are being fed prepackaged military rations known as MREs, or Meals Ready to Eat.\n\nThe criterion for transfer to Guantanamo is currently Venezuelans in ICE custody, the congressional staffers were told. People in that category have been difficult to deport in recent years because of a breakdown in diplomatic relations, although Venezuela sent two flights to pick up some of its citizens who were being deported this week.\n\nAs of Tuesday, ICE had sent a total of 98 men to Guantanamo, according to several people keeping track of flights from El Paso, Texas, to the Navy base in southeast Cuba. Of those, 53 were being held in Camp 6 and being guarded by the military.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has called the would-be deportees \"criminal aliens,\" and administration officials have portrayed them as associates of the Tren de Aragua gang. But officials have not said what that accusation is based on for each man, and the Times could not independently verify the claims.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the other 45 migrants were being held in a lower-security building on the other side of the base. Their guards are members of the Coast Guard, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, McLaughlin said. The names of these migrants were not on the list obtained by the Times.\n\nThe U.S. Southern Command, which operates the terrorism prison, has been streaming staff and support personnel to the base since Trump's order on Jan. 29 for the military and homeland security to prepare to expand a migrant operations center at Guantanamo Bay \"for high-priority criminal aliens unlawfully present in the United States.\"\n\nIt is not known if or when the guards at Camp 6 would be replaced by or augmented with security personnel from homeland security. Meantime, the Pentagon's prison operation, which has Arabic language linguists on staff for the detainees in the war on terrorism, put out a rush announcement called a \"hot fill,\" seeking a Spanish-language interpreter in the Navy to do a 182-day stint at the prison.\n\nOn Wednesday, a group of legal aid organizations sued the Trump administration, asking that migrants who had been taken to Guantanamo Bay be given access to lawyers to see if they want legal representation to challenge their detention there. Gelernt of the ACLU is the lead counsel in that lawsuit.\n\nThe plaintiffs also included relatives of three detainees at the base who said they had lost contact with the men and were deeply worried about them.\n\nTwo of the migrants named in the suit, Luis Alberto Castillo Rivera and Tilso Ramon Gomez Lugo, were on the list of 53 who were being held in Camp 6. Their relatives said they recognized them from pictures released during the government transfer operations.\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that the government has lawful authority to hold al-Qaida suspects in indefinite wartime detention at Guantanamo, under a law passed by Congress that authorizes the use of military force against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nBut it is not clear what legal authority the Trump administration has to hold people arrested in the United States at Guantanamo for immigration detention purposes.\n\n\"When detained within the United States, immigrant detainees have the right to access counsel,\" a request for a court order accompanying the lawsuit said. It added, \"The government cannot eviscerate those rights simply by creating a legal black hole on an island in Cuba.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nThis story was originally published February 12, 2025 at 9:50 PM.", "content_scrape_timestamp": "2025-02-20T10:04:39.972050+00:00", "id": "17fe80a6-5dc1-4e41-a7b5-eb9f56a64461", "metadata": {"relevance_check": {"is_relevant": true, "reason": "The article discusses Venezuelan migrants being held at Guantanamo Bay's Camp 6, guarded by military personnel, and the legal challenges surrounding their detention.

{"title": "Did CIA Director Gina Haspel run a black site at Guantanamo?", "url": "https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article223835570.html", "published_date": 1546959319, "scrape_timestamp": "2025-02-20T09:51:42.110428+00:00", "content": "This article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.\n\nGUANTANAMO BAY NAVY BASE, Cuba \u2014 An attorney for the accused architect of the Sept. 11 attacks told a judge in a secret session last year that CIA Director Gina Haspel ran a secret agency outpost at Guantanamo, an apparent reference to a post-9/11 black site, according to a recently declassified transcript.\n\nThe claim by Rita Radostitz, a lawyer for Khalid Sheik Mohammed, appears in one paragraph of a partially redacted transcript of a secret hearing held at Guantanamo on Nov. 16. Defense lawyers were arguing, in a motion that ultimately failed, that Haspel\u2019s role at the prison precludes the possibility of a fair trial for the men accused of orchestrating the 9/11 attacks who were also held for years in covert CIA prisons.\n\nNeither the public nor the accused was allowed to attend the hearing but, following an intelligence review, the Pentagon released portions of its transcript on a war court website.\n\nHaspel reportedly ran a CIA black site in Thailand where two terror suspects were waterboarded, probably before her arrival there. The unverified statement that she had a similar assignment at the terror-detention center at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, would reveal a never-before disclosed chapter of the spy chief\u2019s clandestine career.\n\nThe CIA declined to comment on the claim.\n\nBut in the transcript of a discussion about CIA torture and restrictions on the lawyers for the alleged plotters of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, Radostitz notes that prosecutors claim they are \u201cnot trying to cover up the torture ... But the one thing that they\u2019re not willing to talk about is the names of the people involved in the torture.\u201d Then, after a large censored section, she says, \u201cit makes it impossible for people at Guantanamo, who may have seen her when she was here as chief of base, to identify her and talk about it.\u201d\n\nChief of base is a CIA term for the officer in charge of a secret foreign outpost. A 2014 Senate study of the CIA\u2019s network of secret overseas prisons, called black sites, said the CIA had two such secret prisons at Guantanamo in 2003 and 2004 \u2014 apart from the Pentagon\u2019s Guantanamo prison known as Camp Delta. While the military prison commanders\u2019 names were disclosed, those who served as CIA chief of base were not.\n\nThe CIA sent the alleged 9/11 conspirators and other \u201chigh-value detainees\u201d to military detention at Guantanamo in September 2006 after the captives spent three or four years in secret spy agency custody. But at least one 9/11 defendant, Ramzi bin al Shibh, was earlier held at Guantanamo, according to the public portion of the 6,200-page Senate Intelligence Committee study of the CIA\u2019s overseas prison program, known as the torture report.\n\nIt says the agency operated two black sites there \u2014 code named Maroon and Indigo \u2014 from September 2003 to April 2004 then spirited them away for fear their captives might be entitled to attorneys.\n\nFormer CIA counterterrorism officer John Kiriakou told McClatchy that he was offered the Guantanamo chief of base position in late 2002 or early 2003 \u2014 and declined. \u201cNobody wanted the job,\u201d he said. So they resorted to sending people on temporary duty assignments ranging from six weeks to nine months, he said.\n\n\u201cIf it was during one of those periods when they couldn\u2019t find somebody to fill the billet it would\u2019ve made sense that she would\u2019ve been there a short period of time,\u201d Kiriakou said, describing a Gitmo stint as essentially a ticket punch for some agents associated with the black site program. \u201cSo when I read it, although I was surprised by it, I kind of believed it.\u201d\n\nFormer CIA analyst Gail Helt, now a professor of Security and Intelligence Studies at King University in Tennessee, said there\u2019s been \u201ca lot of shadiness\u201d with the way the spy agency has spoken about Haspel\u2019s agency career.\n\nAn official CIA timeline of Haspel\u2019s 33-year career notes that the agency won\u2019t disclose 30 short-term, temporary duty assignments she held over the course of her career, suggesting they were covert. \u201cWas one of those at Guantanamo for a couple of months?,\u201d said Helt. \u201cI don\u2019t have personal knowledge of that, and couldn\u2019t discuss it if I did. But it doesn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d\n\nReached by McClatchy, Radostitz said that restrictions imposed on defense attorneys with access to classified information prohibit her from elaborating or commenting on what was said in a closed session.\n\nAccording to the transcript, Radostitz was arguing for dismissal of the charges, or to not make the trial death-penalty eligible, because of Haspel\u2019s role as the top CIA official with control of top secret classifications. The trial judge, Marine Col. Keith Parrella, rejected the argument in December, weeks before the partial transcript was publicly released.\n\nIn it, Radostitz also argued that restrictions on defense attorneys asking questions about Haspel\u2019s overseas black site service hamstrung their ability to prepare to defend Mohammed, who after three and a half years in CIA detention, including 183 rounds of waterboarding, declared that he oversaw the 9/11 attacks \u201cfrom A to Z.\u201d He is among five men charged in a death-penalty case alleging their conspired in the Sept. 11, 2001 hijackings that killed 2,976 people in New York, at the Pentagon and aboard an airliner that crashed in a Pennsylvania field.\n\nNo trial date has been set as lawyers litigate what evidence the defense teams can see. Defense lawyers have been trying to explore what happened to captives at Guantanamo in their continuing bid to argue the case is compromised by the CIA years.\n\nThe CIA held at least five captives there, the report said, including alleged USS Cole bomber Abd al Rahim al Nashiri, whose interrogation in Thailand Haspel reportedly oversaw.\n\nThe circle of officers involved in the black site program in the aftermath of 9/11 was so small Haspel could have run the Guantanamo outpost, said former career CIA officer Glenn Carle, who was sworn in on the same day as Haspel in 1985, but rejected the rendition and enhanced interrogation program as \u201cillegal, unnecessary, and immoral.\u201d\n\n\u201cCould Gina have been chief of base? Certainly,\u201d said Carle, who left the agency in 2007. \u201cI do not know. I could not say if I did. But is it a realistic or plausible assertion to make? Yes. It seems from media descriptions that Gina was in Thailand. At least that was said. And it would not be implausible that an officer would go from place to place given a particular experience in this bizarre subset of operations.\u201d\n\nOn why the agency would neither confirm nor deny an unclassified portion of a transcript alleging a Guantanamo chief of base posting, he said the CIA sees it this way: \u201cThe fact that a classified bit of information is in the public domain is irrelevant to us if we have not confirmed or spoken to it.\u201d\n\nFormer FBI agent Ali Soufan said of Haspel, \u201cI am not aware that she was down there.\u201d Soufan, who conducted interrogations for the bureau at Guantanamo and elsewhere both before and aftermath the Sept. 11 attacks, said during his time at Gitmo the CIA\u2019s chief of base \u201cwas a man and he was really helpful and very good. He was a great team player. We had a good relationship with him and his team.\u201d\n\nSoufan said he does not recall seeing Haspel in Guantanamo but says it is possible that while \u201cshe was chief of base in the black site where Nashiri was, she may had visited Guantanamo.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally published January 8, 2019 at 9:55 AM.", "content_scrape_timestamp": "2025-02-20T10:05:43.057908+00:00", "id": "fb46f019-6ead-40d1-a9db-0f6198d5e262", "metadata": {"relevance_check": {"is_relevant": true, "reason": "The article discusses Gina Haspel's alleged role at a CIA black site at Guantanamo Bay, the legal proceedings of detainees, and allegations of torture and mistreatment.

They\u2019ve found listening devices that looked like smoke detectors in their meeting rooms, which the original case judge had removed; a remote court audio kill switch, which the judge ordered unplugged; and the FBI recruiting defense team informants, which the judge ordered investigated.\n\nThe new judge in the case, Marine Col. Keith Parrella, sought to reassure defense lawyers that none of them were under federal investigation. But the paralegal said in court documents that intelligence agents pointedly asked about defense team dynamics in three days of questioning at Fort Hood, Texas last month.\n\n\u201cThe agents wanted to know all sorts of information about the work of the defense team, the personalities of the team members, the communications,\u201d the paralegal, Army Staff Sgt. Brent Skeete, wrote in a sworn affidavit filed in federal court. They sought \u201cmy opinions of everyone, and lots of other privileged information.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear why the FBI is interested in Skeete.\n\n\u201cWe have no comment in keeping with our usual practice of neither confirming nor denying specific investigations,\u201d FBI spokeswoman Carol Cratty said.\n\nAt the time, Skeete worked for lawyers defending Walid bin Attash, who with Mohammed and three other former CIA captives are accused of training, organizing or helping with travel arrangements and funding the 19 hijackers who crashed passenger airlines into New York\u2019s World Trade Center, a Pennsylvania field and at the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, killing 2,976 people. The five could be executed if they are convicted.\n\nThe accused 9/11 conspirators were interrogated and held for three and four years in secret CIA prisons before President George W. Bush sent them to Guantanamo in 2006, giving the CIA and FBI key classification roles in their cases.\n\nNevin said this episode appeared to be the latest in rolling intelligence agency investigations of himself and his team since 2009 that have never yielded charges against him but appeared to be part of an unending \u201ceffort to intimidate the defense teams. I\u2019d be a little bit off my rocker to think otherwise.\u201d\n\nSkeete, who converted to Islam while in the Army, was in Texas visiting family, and preparing for a new Army paralegal assignment in South Korea when he was called in for questioning \u2014 first by military intelligence, and then by FBI agents.\n\nLast week in Washington, Parrella met with special Justice Department 9/11 case lawyers to hear about the Skeete interview and ruled that current, active 9/11 defense team members are not under federal investigation, and should proceed at this week\u2019s hearing.\n\nDefense lawyers, who have top secret clearances, bristled at the judge\u2019s decision to exclude them from that meeting and rule without hearing from them.\n\nMohammed\u2019s attorneys are separately asking a federal court to remove Parrella from the case because he has worked at the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, which has furnished prosecutors to this 9/11 case.\n\nMonday, Nevin said that without more information about the FBI\u2019s national security investigation of the sergeant, which he said began in November, he and the other lawyers defending Mohammed have a duty not to participate in court litigation. Bin Attash defense attorney Cheryl Bormann has also said, in court filings, that she\u2019s laboring under a conflict and cannot litigate anything else in the case until she know more about the Skeete investigation.\n\nParrella last week ordered Justice Department lawyers to provide defense attorneys with written declarations that say they are not under investigation. A Justice Department lawyer, Jocelyn Ballantine, said the documents might be ready Feb. 1.\n\nThis story was originally published January 28, 2019 at 3:41 PM.", "content_scrape_timestamp": "2025-02-20T10:05:28.984103+00:00", "id": "05057ae5-e727-4813-976b-1992cc57e4fa", "metadata": {"relevance_check": {"is_relevant": true, "reason": "The article discusses legal proceedings, attorney-client privilege concerns, and FBI investigations related to the 9/11 trial at Guantanamo Bay, including specific detainees like Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Walid bin Attash.

{"title": "9/11 plea deal includes lifetime gag order on CIA torture secrets", "url": "https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/article299960709.html", "published_date": 1738985719, "scrape_timestamp": "2025-02-20T09:51:42.110329+00:00", "content": "Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the prisoner at the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, who is accused of plotting the 9/11 attacks, has agreed to never disclose secret aspects of his torture by the CIA if he is allowed to plead guilty rather than face a death-penalty trial.\n\nThe clause was included in the latest portions of his deal to be unsealed at a federal appeals court in Washington. A three-judge panel is considering whether former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin III lawfully withdrew from a plea agreement with Mohammed in the capital case against five men who are accused of conspiring in the attacks that killed nearly 3,000.\n\nThe CIA has never taken a public position on whether it supports the deal, and the agency declined to comment Friday. But the latest disclosure makes clear that Mohammed would not be allowed to publicly identify people, places and other details from his time in the agency\u2019s secret prisons overseas from 2003-06.\n\nIt has been publicly known for years that Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times by the CIA. It has also been revealed that waterboarding was done by a three-person interrogation team led by Bruce Jessen and James E. Mitchell, two former contract psychologists for the agency. Details of Mohammed\u2019s violent treatment, including rectal abuse, have emerged in court filings and leaks.\n\nBut the agency has protected the names of other people who worked in the \u201cblack site\u201d prisons, notably medical staff, guards and other intelligence agency employees who questioned Mohammed hundreds of times as he was shuttled between prisons in Afghanistan, Poland and other locations that have not been acknowledged by the CIA as former black sites.\n\nNow, a recently unredacted paragraph in Mohammed\u2019s 20-page settlement says he agreed not to disclose \u201cany form, in any manner, or by any means\u201d information about his \u201ccapture, detention, confinement of himself or others\u201d while in U.S. custody.\n\nHe signed the agreement July 31, after more than two years of negotiations between his lawyers and prosecutors, who are responsible for protecting national security secrets. Two military courts have ruled that Austin acted too late when he tried to withdraw from the settlement Aug. 2, two days after the retired Army general he put in charge of the case had signed it.\n\nThe settlement and similar agreements with two of Mohammed\u2019s co-defendants, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, are still mostly under seal while defense lawyers seek to enforce the agreement and hold a sentencing hearing at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nSecrecy surrounding the black site program has been one reason for long delays in starting the trial. Mohammed was first charged in this case in 2012. Defense lawyers have spent years litigating for government versions of what happened to Mohammed and the other four defendants in the case, forcing prosecutors to frequently seek permission from the military judges to withhold or redact certain evidence in the case.\n\nThe settlement does allow Mohammed to continue discussing those details with his lawyers while they prepare for a lengthy sentencing trial before a military jury. His lawyers have an independent obligation to keep that information classified.\n\nSeparately Friday, the three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit extended an order preventing the military judge at Guantanamo from holding plea proceedings in the case.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nThis story was originally published February 7, 2025 at 10:35 PM.", "content_scrape_timestamp": "2025-02-20T10:04:40.173746+00:00", "id": "0532a14f-a9af-4665-b955-293fe6aa874f", "metadata": {"relevance_check": {"is_relevant": true, "reason": "The article discusses Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a prisoner at Guantanamo Bay, and his plea deal which includes a gag order on CIA torture secrets.
