Nevin cited concerns about attorney-client confidentiality, alleging intelligence agency interference, including listening devices and recruitment of defense team informants05057ae5-e727-4813-976b-1992cc57e4fa. The paralegal, Army Staff Sgt.

Mohammed's attorneys are also seeking to remove the new judge in the case, Marine Col.

Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is a prisoner at the military prison in Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba0532a14f-a9af-4665-b955-293fe6aa874f. He is accused of plotting the 9/11 attacks0532a14f-a9af-4665-b955-293fe6aa874f. Mohammed has agreed to never disclose secret aspects of his torture by the CIA if he is allowed to plead guilty rather than face a death-penalty trial0532a14f-a9af-4665-b955-293fe6aa874f.

A clause regarding the non-disclosure of his torture was included in the latest portions of his deal to be unsealed at a federal appeals court in Washington0532a14f-a9af-4665-b955-293fe6aa874f. The agreement states he will not disclose information about his capture, detention, or confinement while in U.S. custody0532a14f-a9af-4665-b955-293fe6aa874f. He signed the agreement on July 310532a14f-a9af-4665-b955-293fe6aa874f.

Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times by the CIA 0532a14f-a9af-4665-b955-293fe6aa874f. The waterboarding was done by a three-person interrogation team led by Bruce Jessen and James E. Mitchell, two former contract psychologists for the agency0532a14f-a9af-4665-b955-293fe6aa874f. He was held in CIA "black site" prisons overseas from 2003-060532a14f-a9af-4665-b955-293fe6aa874f, and was shuttled between prisons in Afghanistan, Poland and other locations not acknowledged by the CIA as former black sites0532a14f-a9af-4665-b955-293fe6aa874f.

Mohammed was first charged in this case in 2012 0532a14f-a9af-4665-b955-293fe6aa874f. A sentencing hearing may be held at Guant√°namo Bay0532a14f-a9af-4665-b955-293fe6aa874f.
