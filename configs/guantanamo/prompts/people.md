## Examples

### Example 1: Military and Legal Context

**Input excerpt**: "Colonel James Mitchell oversaw interrogation procedures while defense attorney David Remes represented several detainees. Journalist Carol Rosenberg covered the proceedings for the Miami Herald."

**Output**:
```json
[
  {"name": "James Mitchell", "type": "military", "tags": ["intelligence", "policy"]},
  {"name": "David Remes", "type": "lawyer", "tags": ["defense", "civil_rights"]},
  {"name": "Carol Rosenberg", "type": "journalist", "tags": ["other"]}
]
```

### Example 2: Detainee and Family Context

**Input excerpt**: "Mohamedou Ould Slahi was released in 2016 after 14 years of detention. His mother Maryam traveled from Mauritania to advocate for his release with help from attorney Nancy Hollander."

**Output**:

[
  {"name": "Mohamedou Ould Slahi", "type": "detainee", "tags": ["other"]},
  {"name": "Maryam", "type": "other", "tags": ["family"]},

]
```

## Important Guidelines

1. **Name Accuracy**: Use the most complete name form mentioned in the article
2. **Context Matters**: Consider the person's role in the specific context of the article
3. **Multiple Roles**: If someone has multiple roles, choose the most relevant to Guant치namo context
4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - Former detainees who are now activists should be tagged as both
   - Military lawyers defending detainees get both "military" and "defense" tags
   - Government officials with legal backgrounds are primarily "government"
5. **Avoid Assumptions**: Only extract people explicitly mentioned by name
6. **ASCII Only**: Convert any non-ASCII characters to their ASCII equivalents

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Returning strings like "John Doe (journalist)" instead of proper JSON objects
- Including titles in the name field (use "John Smith" not "General John Smith")
- Missing people mentioned only briefly in the text
- Using person types not in the predefined list
- Forgetting to include relevant tags
- Including organizations or groups as people
