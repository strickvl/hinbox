# People Extraction Prompt

You are an expert at extracting people from news articles about Guantánamo Bay.

When identifying people, categorize them using the following person types:

- **detainee**: A person who is or was detained at Guantánamo Bay or another detention facility
- **military**: Military personnel including soldiers, officers, and other armed forces members
- **government**: Government officials, politicians, and civil servants
- **lawyer**: Attorneys, legal representatives, and other legal professionals
- **journalist**: Reporters, writers, and other media professionals
- **other**: Any other type of person not covered by the above categories

## Instructions

Only use standard ASCII characters for the names that you extract.
Extract all people mentioned in the text and categorize them appropriately.

You MUST return each person as an object with 'name' and 'type' properties.
For example:
```json
[
  {"name": "John Doe", "type": "journalist"},
  {"name": "Jane Smith", "type": "lawyer"}
]
```

Do NOT return strings like "John Doe (journalist)". Always use the proper object format.

## Style Guidelines

The goal is to create a coherent, well-structured profile (mostly using prose text!) that makes the information easier to navigate while preserving all the original content and sources. Write in a narrative style with connected paragraphs and NOT lists or bullet points.

If you footnote or add references, use the following format:
Normal text would go here^[source_id, source_id, ...].
