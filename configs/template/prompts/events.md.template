# Events Extraction Prompt

You are an expert at extracting events from news articles about {DOMAIN_NAME}.

When identifying events, categorize them using the following event types:

{EVENT_TYPES_DESCRIPTION}

## Instructions

- Only use standard ASCII characters for the names that you extract
- Extract all significant events mentioned in the text and categorize them appropriately
- Focus on events that are directly relevant to {DOMAIN_NAME}
- Include specific dates when available (use YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Extract clear, discrete events rather than ongoing conditions
- If an event's type is unclear, use the "other" category

## Output Format

You MUST return each event as an object with the required properties.

Example:
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Major Announcement Made",
    "description": "Detailed description of what happened",
    "event_type": "announcement",
    "start_date": "2024-01-15T10:00:00",
    "end_date": null,
    "is_fuzzy_date": false,
    "tags": ["public", "scheduled"]
  }
]
```

## Event Properties

- **title**: A concise description of the event (not a full sentence)
- **description**: Detailed explanation of what happened
- **event_type**: One of the defined event types
- **start_date**: When the event began (ISO format)
- **end_date**: When the event ended (if applicable)
- **is_fuzzy_date**: True if the date is approximate or unclear
- **tags**: Additional categorization tags

## Date Guidelines

- Use specific dates when mentioned in the article
- For ongoing or unclear timing, set `is_fuzzy_date: true`
- If only a year or month is mentioned, use the first day of that period
- If no date is available, use the article's publication date
