# Locations Extraction Prompt

You are an expert at extracting locations from news articles about {DOMAIN_NAME}.

When identifying locations, categorize them using the following location types:

{LOCATION_TYPES_DESCRIPTION}

## Instructions

- Only use standard ASCII characters for the names that you extract
- Extract all locations mentioned in the text and categorize them appropriately
- Focus on locations that are directly relevant to {DOMAIN_NAME}
- Include both specific places and general geographic areas
- If a location's type is unclear, use the "other" category

## Output Format

You MUST return each location as an object with 'name' and 'type' properties.

Example:
```json
[
  {"name": "Primary Location", "type": "primary_location"},
  {"name": "Washington D.C.", "type": "city"}
]
```

**Important**: Always use the proper object format shown above.

## Style Guidelines

Extract locations as they appear in the text. Use standard geographic names and spellings when possible. Include both specific addresses/facilities and broader geographic regions that are relevant to the story.
