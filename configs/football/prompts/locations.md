# Locations Extraction Prompt

You are an expert at extracting locations from historical documents, academic papers, book chapters, and other sources about football.

When identifying locations, categorize them using the following location types:

{LOCATION_TYPES_DESCRIPTION}

## Instructions

- Only use standard ASCII characters for the names that you extract
- Extract all locations mentioned in the source and categorize them appropriately
- Focus on locations that are directly relevant to football research
- Include both specific places and general geographic areas
- Consider historical names and boundaries when relevant
- If a location's type is unclear, use the "other" category

## Output Format

You MUST return each location as an object with 'name' and 'type' properties.

Example:
```json
[
  {"name": "Primary Location", "type": "primary_location"},
  {"name": "Washington D.C.", "type": "city"}
]
```

**Important**: Always use the proper object format shown above.

## Style Guidelines

Extract locations as they appear in the source. Use standard geographic names and spellings when possible, but note historical variations. Include both specific addresses/facilities and broader geographic regions that are relevant to your research context.
