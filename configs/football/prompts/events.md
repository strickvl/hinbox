# Events Extraction Prompt

You are an expert at extracting events from historical documents, academic papers, book chapters, and other sources about football.

When identifying events, categorize them using the following event types:

{EVENT_TYPES_DESCRIPTION}

## Instructions

- Only use standard ASCII characters for the names that you extract
- Extract all significant events mentioned in the source and categorize them appropriately
- Focus on events that are directly relevant to football research
- Include specific dates when available (use YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Extract clear, discrete events rather than ongoing conditions
- Consider the historical context and significance of events
- If an event's type is unclear, use the "other" category

## Output Format

You MUST return each event as an object with the required properties.

Example:
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Major Announcement Made",
    "description": "Detailed description of what happened",
    "event_type": "announcement",
    "start_date": "2024-01-15T10:00:00",
    "end_date": null,
    "is_fuzzy_date": false,
    "tags": ["public", "scheduled"]
  }
]
```

## Event Properties

- **title**: A concise description of the event (not a full sentence)
- **description**: Detailed explanation of what happened
- **event_type**: One of the defined event types
- **start_date**: When the event began (ISO format)
- **end_date**: When the event ended (if applicable)
- **is_fuzzy_date**: True if the date is approximate or unclear
- **tags**: Additional categorization tags

## Date Guidelines

- Use specific dates when mentioned in the article
- For ongoing or unclear timing, set `is_fuzzy_date: true`
- If only a year or month is mentioned, use the first day of that period
- If no date is available, make a reasonable historical estimate based on context
